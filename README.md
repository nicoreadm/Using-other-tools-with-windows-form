# Using-other-tools-with-windows-form

This is my second job with Windows Forms in C, where I use other tools to perform basic activities such as calculating the salary of person based on the hours worked and a bonus, switching images depending on whether a certain condition is met, and I applied arrays so that if a number from 1 to 7 is selected, it indicates which day of the week corresponds to that number.
